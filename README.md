# Overview
This is my very first project working with PHP. This project will allow me to demonstrate the techniques that I am learning while completing my COP2833 - Data Driven Websites class. 

# Description of my app
This is an events planner web application where users can login, find people to add as friends, create events, and invite friends to events. I am implementing this with PHP, SQL, and Bootstrap. I am not currently using a PHP framework as I am simply learning how PHP works. 

As I grow and learn more about PHP, so will this project. By the end of this class I will have this application running on Heroku with a link to it in this description. Until then...
